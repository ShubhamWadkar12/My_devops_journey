# 📝 Python Basics: Variables, Data Types & Operators

---

## 🔹 Variables
A **variable** is a name given to a memory location in a program.  
It acts as a container to store a value.

```python
a = 1            #variable
b = 'Shubham'    #string
c = 2.5          #float
d = True         #boolean
e = None        #null value
```
- Keywords: Reserved words in Python like if, for, while
- Identifiers: Names used for classes, functions, and variable

## 🔹 Data Types

Python automatically identifies the type of data. Common data types:

Integers (int)

Floating point numbers (float)

Strings (str)

## 🔹 Rules for Choosing an Identifier
Can contain alphabets, digits, and underscores (_)
Must start with an alphabet or underscore
Cannot start with a digit
No spaces are allowed

Examples:
harry, one8, seven, _seven

## 🔹 Operators in Python
Python supports several types of operators:

- Arithmetic Operators:  +, -, *, /, %, **, //
- Assignment Operators:  =, +=, -=, *=, /=
- Comparison Operators:  ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=
- Logical Operators:     and, or, not
- Booleans (bool):      True or False
- None (NoneType):      Null
