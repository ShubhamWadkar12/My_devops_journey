# 🌍 Networking & Application Basics

This document explains key concepts like how the internet works, what servers are, and different types of applications – in a simple and beginner-friendly way.

## ✅ 1. How Does the Internet Work?

The internet connects computers around the world. When you type a website name in the browser:

1. 🧭 It goes to a **DNS** (like a phonebook) to find the website’s IP address  
2. 📡 It sends a request to the **web server**  
3. 🖥️ The server processes the request  
4. 🌐 The server sends back the webpage, which appears in your browser

## ✅ 2. What is a Server?

A **server** is a powerful computer that stores websites, apps, or data.  
It "serves" information when a user sends a request.

💡 **Example:** When you open YouTube, a server sends you the video and page data.

## ✅ 3. Web Server vs Application Server

| 🔹 Feature       | 🌐 Web Server                        | ⚙️ Application Server                    |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**      | Sends static content (HTML, images)  | Runs logic/code to generate content      |
| **Examples**     | Apache, Nginx                        | Tomcat, JBoss                            |
| **Main Role**    | Handles browser (HTTP) requests      | Handles business logic and app data      |

## ✅ 4. Types of Applications

There are mainly 3 types:

- 🖥️ **Standalone Apps** – Run on a single device (e.g., VLC Media Player)
- 🌐 **Web Apps** – Run in browsers (e.g., Gmail, Google Docs)
- 📱 **Mobile Apps** – Installed on phones (e.g., WhatsApp)

## ✅ 5. What are Standalone Apps?

These apps:
- Work without an internet connection  
- Run locally on one device only  

💡 **Examples:** Calculator, Notepad, MS Paint

---

## ✅ 6. What are Web Applications?

These apps:
- Run in a **web browser**  
- **Need the internet** to work  
- Don’t need installation on your system  

💡 **Examples:** Google Docs, Amazon, Flipkart

## 🔘 7. What is Application Support?

Support activities done **after the app is deployed**, to help users and ensure smooth working.

Includes:
- 🐞 Fixing bugs  
- 📞 Answering user issues  
- 📊 Monitoring application health and uptime

---

## 🔘 8. What is Application Maintenance?

Ongoing updates and improvements made **after the app is live**.

Includes:
- ✨ Adding new features  
- ⚡ Improving speed and design  
- 🐛 Fixing hidden issues
