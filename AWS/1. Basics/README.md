# ☁️ **Cloud Computing Overview**

**What is cloud computing?**
> delivering computing services over the internet instead of using local servers or personal devices. Cloud = Using someone else's computer (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) over the internet to store data, run applications, or access services.

**What cloud includes?**
> - Storage – Like Google Drive or Dropbox (store files online)
> - Servers – Run websites or apps (e.g., hosting a website on AWS EC2)
> - Databases – Cloud-based databases like Amazon RDS or Firebase
> - Networking – Secure communication and load balancing
> - Software as a Service (SaaS) – Using apps via browser (e.g., Gmail, Zoom)
> - Platform as a Service (PaaS) – Developers build apps without managing servers
> - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – Full control over cloud servers and storage
✅ **Why Cloud is Popular in IT?**
> - Scalable – Add or remove resources anytime
> - Cost-effective – Pay only for what you use
> - Accessible – Work from anywhere
> - Reliable – High uptime with backups
> - Secure – Advanced security tools and encryption

### 🤜🤛 Public Cloud vs Private Cloud

| 🔍 **Point**      | 🌐 **Public Cloud**                       | 🏢 **Private Cloud**                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who owns it?**  | Big companies like AWS, Google, Microsoft | Your company or a private vendor                   |
| **Who uses it?**  | Anyone can use it (shared with others)    | Only your company uses it                          |
| **Cost**          | Cheaper (pay only for what you use)       | More expensive (you set it up and maintain it)     |
| **Security**      | Good, but shared with others              | Very secure (only you use it)                      |
| **Speed & Scale** | Very fast and can grow easily             | Not as fast to grow – needs planning               |
| **Control**       | Less control (provider manages it)        | Full control (you manage everything)               |
| **Use Case**      | Good for websites, apps, small companies  | Good for banks, hospitals, government use          |
| **Example**       | Using Google Drive or hosting on AWS      | A bank's private system inside its own data center |
