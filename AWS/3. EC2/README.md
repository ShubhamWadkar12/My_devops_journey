# 🖥️ AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

**Amazon EC2** is a web service that lets you **rent virtual computers (called instances)** to run your applications, just like a regular computer but in the cloud.

---

### 💡 Simple Explanation

> Imagine you're renting a computer from Amazon. You can:
> - Choose how powerful it is (CPU, RAM, storage)
> - Pick the operating system (like Ubuntu, Windows)
> - Turn it on or off anytime
> - Pay only for the time you use it

---

### 📌 What Can You Do with EC2?

- 🌐 Host websites and applications
- ⚙️ Run APIs, backend servers, or databases
- 🧠 Train machine learning models
- 🐳 Deploy Docker containers
- 📁 Automate tasks or processes

---

### 🧠 Why “Elastic”?

Because EC2 is **flexible and scalable** you can:
- Start or stop instances anytime
- Resize them (scale up/down)
- Add more instances when traffic increases

---

### 🛠️ Real-World Example

You can launch a **Linux EC2 instance**, install Python or Node.js, upload your code, and access it from anywhere **without needing a physical computer**.

---

> 🔐 EC2 gives you full control of your virtual server, making it a powerful tool for developers, sysadmins, and cloud engineers.

### ⚙️ Key EC2 Configuration Terms

When launching an EC2 instance, you need to configure a few important components:

- 🧮 **Instance Type**:  
  Select the hardware capacity for example, how much **CPU**, **RAM**, etc., your server will have.

- 🖥️ **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**:  
  Choose the **operating system** and base software like **Linux**, **Mac**, or **Windows**.

- 💾 **Storage**:  
  Define the **type and size** of your storage (e.g., **EBS volume**) based on your needs.

- 🔐 **Security Groups**:  
  Set up **firewall rules** to control what kind of traffic is **allowed in and out** of your instance (like allowing SSH or HTTP access).

- 🔑 **Key Pair**:  
  Create or use an existing **key pair** to enable **SSH access** to your EC2 instance securely.

---

> 🧠 Tip: These settings define how your virtual server behaves. Choose based on your use case whether it's a personal project, web hosting, or production app.
